        <h3>The Application of Small Molecule Drugs: Cancer Therapy</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, the three forms of therapy for Cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery is fairly straightforward and is used to remove the tumor and nearby tissue during an operation. There are several adverse side effects to cancer surgery which include numbness, lymphedema, appetite loss, swelling, and organ dysfunction (V. Lavanya, M. Adil, N. Ahmed, A. Rishi, S. Jamal, 2014). As for Chemotherapy, drugs are used in order to target and kill the rapidly dividing cancer cells. However, many of these drugs are unable to distinguish the difference between normal cells and cancer cells, which can cause them to target normal cells as well - causing damage to bone marrow, hair follicles, and digestive tracks. This causes the patient, being treated by chemotherapy, to experience adverse effects including diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, alopecia, and nausea, just to list a few. When it comes to radiation therapy, high-energy waves (in the form of radiation) are used to destroy cancer cells. However, similar to the effects of chemotherapy, radiation therapy can cause swelling in tissues, pose harm to epithelial surfaces, and can incur patients to intestinal damage. Many popular, current cancer therapy systems being used in the industry combine the methodologies of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Because of the many adverse effects posed by current forms of therapy, Cancer Research has been shifted towards the fields of targeted cancer therapy - using the approach of searching for specific molecular targets, which can help slow down or diminish the effects of cancer on the body and nearby cells. Using targeted cancer therapy methods, research is able to differentiate healthy cells and cancer cells- avoiding any healthy cells being destroyed, and side effects occurring.
            <br> When it comes to targeted drug delivery and therapy, there are two types of compounds that can be used: Small Molecule Drugs and Macromolecule drugs (G. Wilkes, 2018). The main
            difference between the two are size; Macromolecule are about 150,000 Da, while small molecule drugs are less than 500 Da. Due to the small size of these small molecule drugs, they are able to easily and effortlessly traverse through cell membranes, bind to cell receptors or targets, and do the task they were designed to do. When it comes to cancer therapy and targeted drug delivery using these molecules, the two main options used in clinical practice include small molecule agents and monoclonal antibodies (macromolecule).
