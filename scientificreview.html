        <h3>Scientific Review</h3>
        <h4>Small Molecule Kinase inhibitors</h4>
        Protein kinase is a type of enzyme which is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group, from ATP to protein residues. Phosphates, in contrast, have the exact opposite function of protein kinase, where they are responsible for removing a phosphate group from a protein. The counter mechanisms between the protein kinase and phosphates are what cause the regulation of protein activity in the body and improve the plasticity of the epigenome. However, when the protein kinase is overexpressed, it messes up this balance- and in turn causes promotion in cell proliferation, survival, and growth. The biochemical reaction that protein kinase is responsible for catalyzing is: MgATP1−+protein−O:H→protein−O:PO32−+MgADP+H+
        The protein kinase enzyme supports and carries out many things which have an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Protein Kinase inhibitors have the job of regulating these protein kinases, preventing, and proving therapy for the various disease protein kinases are linked to- including cancer. The Protein Kinase inhibitors are
        classified into six different types, all of which have separate binding locations and functions (See Figure 1).

            RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases, is one of the most common targets for anti-cancer drugs. Activation of these targets have been linked to the downstream signaling involving pivotal cytoplasmic kinases being activated. In turn, this causes increased cell growth and survival, especially in cancer cells, and is found to contribute to the progression and spreading of cancer. In many cancers, the activation and overexpression of these RTKs leads to promotion in cancer cell growth and survival, contributing to cancer-associated angiogenesis. So, by preventing and regulating these RTKs, we are able to control and manage cancer cell growth. To go more in detail, scientists and researchers have observed that the activation of tyrosine kinase leads to a downstream signaling cascade- which sends a signal through a certain pathway affecting various
different growth factor receptors. These growth factor receptors, when activated, can have a big effect on the development and progression of neoplastic diseases, like cancer.

            There have been many FDA-approved kinase inhibitors that have made it past clinical trials and into general use for cancer patients, one of which includes Crizotinib. This drug, manufactured by Xalkori, is a small molecule inhibitor drug used to treat NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and ALCL (anaplastic large cell lymphoma). It can be administered orally through a capsule and works by blocking the action of a natural substance, Tyrosine, which is needed to help cancer cells multiply and grow.
        <h3>Small Molecule MMPs, HSPs inhibitors</h3>
        <br>
            MMPs, Matrix metalloproteinases, are a group of endopeptidases like the protein kinase. However, the difference between them is their functions- MMPs are involved in the degradation of extracellular matrices (See Figure 2), which is known for promoting cell invasion and migration. There are over 20 MMPs that are naturally in humans, and they are generally regulated by the TIMPs (tissue inducers of metalloproteinases). When a patient has cancer, certain gelatinases like MMP-2 and MMP-9 turn to target signaling pathways and aggravate cancer cell migration and invasion. This causes the promotion of cancer-related tumor growth and metastasis spreading. However, these MMPs did not find great success at clinical trials and came with certain side effects making it less desirable than Kinase inhibitors, for example. The main reason why they were not able to pass the clinical trials was because of the fact that the MMP inhibitors would non-specifically bind to a variety of different MMPs in the body- including a few that were not identified as having cancer-promotion functions. This means that certain normal, healthy MMPs are harmed which can lead to various adverse side effects in the body.
