                <h1>The Application of Small Molecule Drugs: Cancer Therapy</h1>
                <h2>By Abhinav Simhadri</h2>
                <p>
                    According to the World Health Organization, Cancer is one of the worldâ€™s deadliest diseases and is the second leading cause of 
                    death in the United States. Cancer has been responsible for almost 10 million deaths worldwide in 2020, with the most common forms 
                    of cancer being breast, lung, and colon & rectum cancer. To put into scale just how deadly the disease is, the rate of cancer deaths 
                    per year is about 158 per 100,000 men and women. Current traditional cancer therapies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and 
                    surgery. Although these traditional cancer therapy methods have been somewhat effective over the past decades, they come with serious 
                    adverse health effects and have been related to very serious long-term side effects. As a result, over the recent years, targeted 
                    cancer therapy using small molecule drugs has become a focus in the medical field of cancer treatment. Small molecule drugs have a 
                    very advanced and tunable targeting ability which is effective in passing through cell membranes and reaching their designed 
                    intracellular targets. Most of these drugs can be administered orally, and due to their very small size, they are able to pass through 
                    a variety of obstacles in order to inhibit certain cancer-related biomolecules. <br> In this review, I provide a summary of several 
                    different SMIs (small molecule inhibitors) that can be used in cancer therapy and explain recent advances as well as future outlooks in the field of SMIs for cancer treatment.
